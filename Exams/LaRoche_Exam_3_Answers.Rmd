#Part A

##1 Glaucoma Screening
a) 

```{r parta, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(pander)
gl <- matrix(c(87,14,103,14,362,376), 3, 2)
gl <- cbind(gl, apply(gl, 1, sum))
rownames(gl) <- c("Test +", "Test -", "Total")
colnames(gl) <- c("Glaucoma Pos", "Gloucoma Neg", "Total")
pandoc.table(gl)
```

b) Sensitivity = 87/103x100 = `r round(87/103*100, 1)`

c) Specificity = 362/376x100 = `r round(362/376*100, 1)`

d) PPV = 87/101x100 = `r round(87/101*100, 1)`

e) NPV = 362/376 = `r round(362/376*100, 1)`

f) Yes, since this test has a high specificity and negative predictive value the risk of incorectly classifying a patient as having gloucoma is small.
